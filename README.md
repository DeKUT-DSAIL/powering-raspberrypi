# POWERING THE RASPBERRY PI IN THE FIELD

The Raspberry Pi is a single board computer that runs on a Debian based operating system. The Raspberry Pi finds many applications due the fact it can operate like a normal computer and its ability to interact with the outside world using sensors. Due to it small size, it make it easier to deploy in the field for applications that require high computing capabilities that are not found in microcontrollers. When deploying sensor systems in the field, power is one of the most important factors to consider. The fact that the Raspberry Pi operates like a normal computer makes it even more important. Shutting the Raspberry Pi unconventionally due to power outage may result to corruption of it storage leading to loss of one's work and/or data. It is for this reason the we developed the [DSAIL Power Management Board](https://kiariegabriel.github.io/powering-the-raspberrypi.html) to power the Raspberry Pi in the field intelligently.
